## Background

Among machine learning, there was a task to create a bot that responds to natural language using LSTM (a kind of RNN).

At that time, a large amount of conversation corpus is required, but since I did not get a good conversation corpus, I decided to make a conversation corpus by crawling the Ask.fm question answer list with Selenium (Google Chrome) Did.

I'm using Selenium for Python because my favorite programming language is Python.

## Install

### Precondition

- Python 3.6+
- Google Chrome
- [Google Chrome WebDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
  - Check your Chrome version and install suitable driver version.

### PIP

```

## Usage

### Create faces list (Account list)

Before create conversation corpus, create `face list` because of crawling QA.

```
python src/get_faces.py 100
```

After run script, get face list into `data/face_list.txt`

### Create conversation corpus
